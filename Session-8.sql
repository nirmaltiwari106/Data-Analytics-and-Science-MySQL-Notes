--> there must be 1 common attribute in each table to join each other.

In MySQL, joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related 
column between them. Joins allow you to retrieve data from multiple tables in a single 
query, making it easier to work with relational databases.

1. INNER JOIN:
   - Definition: The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.
   - Purpose: To retrieve only the rows where there is a match in both tables, effectively filtering out 
   non-matching rows.
   
   - Example:
     SELECT a.EmployeeID, a.Name, b.DepartmentName
     FROM Employees a
     INNER JOIN Departments b ON a.DepartmentID = b.DepartmentID;

2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN):
   - Definition: The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table and the matched records from 
   the right table.
   
   - Purpose: To retrieve all records from the left table regardless of whether there is a match in the right 
   table, allowing for NULL values in the result set for non-matching rows.
   
   - Example:
     SELECT a.EmployeeID, a.Name, b.DepartmentName
     FROM Employees a
     LEFT JOIN Departments b ON a.DepartmentID = b.DepartmentID;

3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN):
   - Definition: The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table and the matched records from 
   the left table.
   
   - Purpose: To retrieve all records from the right table regardless of whether there is a match in the left 
   table, allowing for NULL values in the result set for non-matching rows.
   
   - Example:
     SELECT a.EmployeeID, a.Name, b.DepartmentName
     FROM Employees a
     RIGHT JOIN Departments b ON a.DepartmentID = b.DepartmentID;

4. FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN):
   - Definition: The FULL JOIN keyword returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table 
   records.
   
   - Purpose: To retrieve all records from both tables, including those that do not have matches in either table. 
   MySQL does not support FULL JOIN directly, but it can be simulated using a combination of LEFT JOIN and 
   RIGHT JOIN with a UNION.
   
   - Example:
     SELECT a.EmployeeID, a.Name, b.DepartmentName
     FROM Employees a
     LEFT JOIN Departments b ON a.DepartmentID = b.DepartmentID
     UNION
     SELECT a.EmployeeID, a.Name, b.DepartmentName
     FROM Employees a
     RIGHT JOIN Departments b ON a.DepartmentID = b.DepartmentID;

5. LEFT EXCLUSIVE JOIN:
   - Definition: This is not a standard SQL join type, but it can be simulated by using a LEFT JOIN and 
   filtering out the matched records from the right table.
   
   - Purpose: To retrieve records from the left table that do not have corresponding records in the right table.
   
   - Example:
     SELECT a.EmployeeID, a.Name
     FROM Employees a
     LEFT JOIN Departments b ON a.DepartmentID = b.DepartmentID
     WHERE b.DepartmentID IS NULL;

6. RIGHT EXCLUSIVE JOIN:
   - Definition: Similar to the left exclusive join, this is not a standard SQL join type but can be simulated 
   using a RIGHT JOIN and filtering out the matched records from the left table.
   
   - Purpose: To retrieve records from the right table that do not have corresponding records in the left table.
   
   - Example:
     SELECT b.DepartmentID, b.DepartmentName
     FROM Employees a
     RIGHT JOIN Departments b ON a.DepartmentID = b.DepartmentID
     WHERE a.EmployeeID IS NULL;

7. CROSS JOIN:
   - Definition: The CROSS JOIN keyword returns the Cartesian product of both tables, meaning it combines 
   every row of the first table with every row of the second table.
   
   - Purpose: To generate a combination of all records from both tables, which can be useful in certain 
   scenarios but may result in a large number of rows in the result set.
   
   - Example:
     SELECT a.EmployeeID, b.DepartmentName
     FROM Employees a
     CROSS JOIN Departments b;

8. SELF JOIN:
   - Definition: A SELF JOIN is a regular join but the table is joined with itself.
   
   - Purpose: To compare rows within the same table, such as finding hierarchical relationships or related 
   data within the same dataset.
   - Example:
     SELECT a.EmployeeID, a.Name, b.Name AS ManagerName
     FROM Employees a
     INNER JOIN Employees b ON a.ManagerID = b.EmployeeID;

In summary, joins are a powerful feature in SQL that allow you to combine data from multiple tables based on 
relationships between them. Understanding how to use different types of joins effectively is crucial for 
querying relational databases.

1. A SELF JOIN is a regular join but the table joins with itself.
2. We use table aliases to differentiate between two references.
3. It is mostly used to compare rows in the same table 
   OR to build hierarchy/relationship inside the same table.
4. Syntax:
      SELECT a.col, b.col
      FROM table a
